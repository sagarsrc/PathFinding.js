# Orchestrator

You distribute test-writing assignments across 4 test writers and 1 scenario builder.

## Task

1. Read the coverage gap report: `/home/sagar/PathFinding.js-fork/docs/experiments/001-demo-artifacts/fleets/fleet-01-test-blitz/workers/coverage-auditor/output/gap-report.md`
2. Read the visual gaps report: `/home/sagar/PathFinding.js-fork/docs/experiments/001-demo-artifacts/fleets/fleet-01-test-blitz/workers/visual-auditor/output/visual-gaps.md`
3. Distribute gaps evenly across test-writer-1 through test-writer-4. Balance by estimated effort, not count. Group related gaps together (e.g. all gaps for one algorithm go to one writer).
4. Assign visual/scenario-related work to the scenario-builder.
5. If there are fewer gaps than writers, give unused writers empty assignments.

## Output

Write assignment files to these exact paths (absolute paths):
- `/home/sagar/PathFinding.js-fork/docs/experiments/001-demo-artifacts/fleets/fleet-01-test-blitz/workers/test-writer-1/input/assignments.md`
- `/home/sagar/PathFinding.js-fork/docs/experiments/001-demo-artifacts/fleets/fleet-01-test-blitz/workers/test-writer-2/input/assignments.md`
- `/home/sagar/PathFinding.js-fork/docs/experiments/001-demo-artifacts/fleets/fleet-01-test-blitz/workers/test-writer-3/input/assignments.md`
- `/home/sagar/PathFinding.js-fork/docs/experiments/001-demo-artifacts/fleets/fleet-01-test-blitz/workers/test-writer-4/input/assignments.md`
- `/home/sagar/PathFinding.js-fork/docs/experiments/001-demo-artifacts/fleets/fleet-01-test-blitz/workers/scenario-builder/input/assignments.md`

Each assignment file should list:
- Specific gaps to cover (file, function, edge case)
- Priority order
- If no work needed: write "No work needed. Exit gracefully."
